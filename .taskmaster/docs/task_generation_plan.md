# Task Generation Plan: Align Codebase to PRD

## 1. Project Audit & Baseline Testing
- **Task:** Audit the current codebase for existing features, gaps, and technical debt.
- **Test:** Run all existing backend and frontend tests. Document current coverage and any failing tests.
- **Deliverable:** Baseline audit report.

## 2. Backend: API & Database Foundations
- **Task:** Ensure all session, agent, and conversation history APIs are implemented and tested.
  - CRUD for sessions and agents
  - Conversation history endpoints
  - User authentication and authorization
- **Test:**
  - Use Postman or integration tests to verify all endpoints (create, read, update, delete, list, history).
  - Test error handling (invalid input, unauthorized access, etc.).
- **Deliverable:** Passing API test suite and documentation.

## 3. Backend: LLM Integration
- **Task:** Verify and, if needed, refactor LLM provider integration for prompt/response flow.
  - Support for multiple LLMs (mock, Claude, etc.)
  - Error handling and timeouts
- **Test:**
  - Mock LLM calls in test environment.
  - Simulate LLM errors and verify graceful handling.
- **Deliverable:** LLM integration test results.

## 4. Backend: Session Persistence & Audit Trail
- **Task:** Ensure session creation, resumption, and history review are fully supported and persisted.
- **Test:**
  - Create, resume, and review sessions via API.
  - Verify audit trail completeness in the database.
- **Deliverable:** Session persistence test log.

## 5. Frontend: UI Layout & Navigation
- **Task:** Review and update the UI to match PRD requirements:
  - Main dashboard with session list and "resume/review" options
  - Agent pipeline editor (with template selection)
  - Conversation flow with progress tracker
- **Test:**
  - Manual and automated UI tests for navigation, layout, and responsiveness.
- **Deliverable:** UI screenshots and test results.

## 6. Frontend: Agent Configuration & Templates
- **Task:** Implement or enhance agent configuration UI:
  - Support for selecting templates and customizing agent pipelines
  - LLM-powered agent persona creation wizard
  - Flexible context wiring (multi-select for context sources)
- **Test:**
  - Create and edit agent pipelines; verify correct context flow.
  - Test LLM-powered wizard with mock and real LLMs.
- **Deliverable:** Demo video or screenshots of agent configuration flow.

## 7. Frontend: Conversation Flow & Quality Gates
- **Task:** Ensure users can review/edit/approve prompts and responses at each step.
  - Manual and auto modes
  - Progress tracker and status indicators
- **Test:**
  - Simulate a full session in both modes; verify all approval gates.
  - Test error and retry flows.
- **Deliverable:** Test log and user feedback.

## 8. Frontend: Session Review & Audit Trail
- **Task:** Implement session review UI for users to audit past sessions and outputs.
- **Test:**
  - Resume and review sessions; verify all data is displayed correctly.
- **Deliverable:** Session review demo.

## 9. Export & Output Customization
- **Task:** Ensure users can export the final brief and agent outputs in user-configurable formats.
- **Test:**
  - Export in all supported formats; verify content and structure.
- **Deliverable:** Example exported briefs.

## 10. Comprehensive Testing & QA
- **Task:** Run full regression, integration, and user acceptance tests.
- **Test:**
  - Automated and manual tests for all critical paths.
  - Accessibility and performance checks.
- **Deliverable:** Final QA report.

## 11. Documentation & Handover
- **Task:** Update user and developer documentation to reflect new features and workflows.
- **Test:**
  - Peer review of documentation.
- **Deliverable:** Updated docs.
