# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Vision
Design Document Generator is a web-based tool that revolutionizes the creation of software design documents through AI-assisted generation, interactive editing, and collaborative review processes.

## Purpose
The Design Document Generator is a human-in-the-loop AI system that transforms a simple app idea into a comprehensive frontend development brief through a multi-agent workflow. The system orchestrates a user-configurable pipeline of specialized AI agents (e.g., Product Strategist, Customer Persona, UI/UX Product Manager, Creative Director, Market Researcher, Visual Researcher, Frontend Architect) that work sequentially or in custom order to analyze, research, and synthesize information into a complete technical specification. Users can select from suggested workflow templates or design their own, with LLM-powered guidance at every step.

## Target Audience
- Software development teams
- Project managers
- Technical writers
- Software architects

## Main Features
1. **AI-Assisted Document Generation**
   - Use of configurable agents to assist in document creation.
2. **Customizable Agent Configurations**
   - Agents can be customized with different roles, names, icons, and prompt templates.
   - Users can select from pre-configured agent personality types, use workflow templates, or walk through LLM-assisted agent persona creation and configuration.
   - Each agent can select outputs from any previous agents as context, supporting flexible information flow.
3. **Interactive Conversation Flow**
   - Dialogue-driven interface for gathering requirements and guiding document creation.
   - User can edit and approve each section before proceeding.
4. **Configuration Management and Version Control**
   - Save, load, and modify configurations; manage document versions.
5. **Session Management and Persistence**
   - Users can create, resume, and review sessions, with full conversation history and agent outputs persisted in the backend.
   - The UI exposes session review and audit trail features as a core part of the user experience.
6. **Quality Gate Process**
   - For each agent, the system generates a context-aware prompt, presents it for user review/editing, sends the approved prompt to the AI, and requires user approval of the response before proceeding.
   - Supports both manual (human-in-the-loop) and auto (AI-only) modes.
7. **Comprehensive Logging and Debugging Tools**
   - Log viewer and debugging utilities for transparency and troubleshooting.
8. **Flexible Output Structure**
   - The final brief's structure is user-configurable, with recommended templates and LLM-powered guidance, but not strictly enforced.
   - Users can export the final brief and agent outputs.
9. **Suggested Workflows & Templates**
   - The system provides a library of workflow and agent configuration templates (e.g., canonical 7-agent, MVP 3-agent, etc.).
   - Users can select a template as a starting point and customize it, with LLM-powered guidance.
10. **Progress Tracker & Transparency**
    - Visual progress tracker shows which agents have completed their work and provides transparency into each step.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Frontend**
   - React-based SPA using TypeScript
   - Modular component architecture
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Vite.js for build and development
2. **Backend**
   - Node.js with Express.js
   - SQL database with migration support
   - RESTful API architecture
   - Authentication and authorization system
   - Integration with AI language models (LLMs)

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Page load time < 2 seconds
   - API response time < 500ms
2. **Scalability**
   - Support for concurrent users (define specific number as needed)
3. **Security**
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Secure session management and token-based authentication
   - Input validation and rate limiting
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Availability**
   - 99.9% uptime
5. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Best Practices & Improvements
- Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Enforce code quality with ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks
- Improve inline code and API documentation
- Set up robust logging and monitoring
- Ensure responsive design and mobile compatibility
- Implement global error boundaries and centralized error handling
- Plan for API versioning and progressive enhancement
- Add offline support with service workers

## Technical Walkthrough
### Architecture Overview & Core Components
- Sequential Multi-Agent Pipeline pattern with Human-in-the-Loop Quality Gates.
- Each agent has a configurable prompt template and context sources (can select outputs from any previous agents).
- Core components: Session Management, Agent Configuration, Context Building, Quality Gate, LLM Integration, Status Tracking, Progress Tracker.

### Data Flow & State Management
- Input Processing: User input → Session storage → Context building
- Prompt Generation: Context + Agent template → Generated prompt → User review
- LLM Processing: Approved prompt → LLM API → Raw response → Response parsing
- Response Processing: Parsed response → User review → Approved response → Context update
- Pipeline Progression: Agent completion → Next agent trigger → Repeat until final agent
- State Management: React state for session, agent, workflow, and UI

### User Experience Flow
- Users experience a guided, conversational process with full control over quality and agent configuration.
- The visual progress tracker shows agent completion status.
- Users can edit agent configurations, modify prompts, and refine responses at each step.
- The system maintains a full audit trail for compliance and review.

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time collaboration features
2. Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git)
3. Advanced analytics and reporting
4. Mobile application for on-the-go access
5. AI-powered document quality assessment
6. Internationalization (i18n) support (deferred)

This PRD provides a foundation for further development and refinement of the Design Document Generator application, ensuring alignment with user needs and technical feasibility.
