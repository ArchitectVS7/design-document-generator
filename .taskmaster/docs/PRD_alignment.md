# PRD Compliance Audit Report

## 1. Agent Configuration & Pipeline
- **Code:** Agent configuration is fully supported in both backend and frontend. Users can edit agent roles, names, prompt templates, and context sources. The UI (AgentEditor, AgentList) allows for flexible pipeline editing and context wiring.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 2. Session Persistence & Audit Trail
- **Code:** Session creation, persistence, and review are supported in backend and exposed in frontend hooks. The UI supports session management, but session review/audit trail features could be more prominent in the main user flow.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️ (Recommend: Ensure session review is a primary UI feature.)

## 3. LLM Integration
- **Code:** LLM provider abstraction exists, with support for multiple providers and error handling. Prompt formatting and response parsing are implemented.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 4. Workflow Templates & Guided Setup
- **Code:** Agent configuration supports templates, but the UI for selecting/applying workflow templates and LLM-powered guided setup is not fully implemented.
- **PRD Match:** ❌ (Recommend: Add UI for template selection and LLM-guided configuration.)

## 5. Quality Gate (Prompt/Response Approval)
- **Code:** Manual and auto modes are supported. Users can review and approve prompts and responses. UI components for quality gates are present.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 6. Progress Tracker
- **Code:** Progress tracking is implemented in ConversationFlow and related UI.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 7. Export & Output Customization
- **Code:** Export functionality is present in the configuration manager and document export UI. Multiple formats are supported.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 8. Logging & Debugging Tools
- **Code:** Logging utilities exist, and there is a LogViewer component. Debugging support is present.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 9. End-to-End Testing
- **Code:** There are references to test utilities and test strategies, but comprehensive E2E test coverage should be verified.
- **PRD Match:** ⚠️ (Recommend: Review and expand E2E test coverage.)

## 10. Security Enhancements
- **Code:** Security features (auth, error handling, input validation) are present. Some Supabase-specific features are not implemented (see userService.js).
- **PRD Match:** ⚠️ (Recommend: Complete Supabase integration and review security for all endpoints.)

## 11. UI/UX: Context Wiring, Manual/Auto Mode, Error Handling
- **Code:** UI supports context wiring, manual/auto mode, and error handling. Validation and user feedback are present.
- **PRD Match:** ✔️

## 12. Agent Persona Creation (LLM-Guided)
- **Code:** AgentEditor supports manual persona creation, but LLM-guided persona creation wizard is not yet implemented.
- **PRD Match:** ❌ (Recommend: Implement LLM-powered persona creation wizard.)

## 13. Accessibility & Responsive Design
- **Code:** Tailwind CSS and React are used for responsive design. Accessibility is partially addressed (ARIA, keyboard navigation in some components).
- **PRD Match:** ⚠️ (Recommend: Conduct accessibility audit and improve ARIA/keyboard support.)

## 14. Documentation & User Guidance
- **Code:** There is code-level documentation and some user guidance in the UI. Full user/developer documentation should be reviewed for completeness.
- **PRD Match:** ⚠️ (Recommend: Update and expand documentation.)
