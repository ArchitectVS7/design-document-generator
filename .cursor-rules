# Cursor Rules for Design Document Generator v0.7.0

## Current Phase Protection
- Only modify files explicitly listed in the current phase
- Do not modify files from other phases unless explicitly requested
- Always confirm which files you plan to modify before making changes

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implement proper error handling
- Add console.log for debugging during development

## File Organization
/src
  /components     # React components
  /types         # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils         # Utility functions
  /services      # API and external service calls
  /hooks         # Custom React hooks
  /data          # Static data and configurations

## Version Control
- Current version: 0.7.0
- All changes must be tested before commit
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Work on feature branches for each phase
