feat: Complete rewrite for Render deployment optimization

This commit introduces comprehensive changes to optimize the Design Document
Generator for deployment on Render's platform.

Backend Changes:
- Enhanced database connectivity with retry logic and connection pooling
- Improved CORS handling with dynamic origin validation
- Added request ID tracking for better debugging
- Implemented graceful shutdown and health checks
- Created database proxy service for PostgreSQL operations
- Fixed all critical linting errors in modified files
- Added automatic database migration in production

Frontend Changes:
- Dynamic API URL detection for different environments
- Enhanced error handling with retry logic
- Added TypeScript declarations for environment variables
- Improved build configuration for production

Deployment Configuration:
- Added render.yaml for automated deployment
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Added environment variable examples
- Included human task checklist for manual steps

Infrastructure:
- Optimized for Render's free tier initially
- SSL auto-configuration for database connections
- Security headers and rate limiting
- Production-ready error handling

All original files have been backed up with '_' prefix for comparison.
The application now auto-detects its environment and configures accordingly.

Closes: #[issue-number]
